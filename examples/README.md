# Examples

Small scripts, one per common task. Each one is a complete `example.php` you can read from top to bottom and adapt.

| Example | What it shows |
|---|---|
| [create-facturx-with-own-pdf](create-facturx-with-own-pdf/example.php) | Create a Factur-X invoice that keeps your own PDF layout, passed as a public URL (`pdfUrl`). |
| [create-cii-and-embed](create-cii-and-embed/example.php) | Build a CII XML from your invoice data with `createCii()`, then embed it into a PDF you already have with `embedFacturx()`. |
| [validate-invoices](validate-invoices/example.php) | Validate a Factur-X PDF, optionally against the French BR-FR rules, print every finding, and save the printable validation report. |
| [render-xml-to-pdf](render-xml-to-pdf/example.php) | Turn any invoice XML (CII, UBL or XRechnung) into a readable PDF. |
| [convert-ubl-to-facturx](convert-ubl-to-facturx/example.php) | Convert a UBL invoice XML into a Factur-X invoice. |
| [transform-to-facturx](transform-to-facturx/example.php) | Turn an ordinary PDF invoice into a Factur-X invoice. AI reads the PDF, so a person checks the result. |
| [parse-pdf-invoice](parse-pdf-invoice/example.php) | Read an ordinary PDF invoice, typed, scanned or photographed, into invoice data with AI, and see how sure the read was per area. |
| [extract-json-and-attachments](extract-json-and-attachments/example.php) | Read a received Factur-X invoice as invoice data and save its embedded attachments as a ZIP. |

## Run an example

1. Install the dependencies once from the repository root with `composer install`.
2. Open the example's `example.php` and replace the values at the top: `YOUR_API_KEY` with your API key, and the file paths or URLs with your own. An example whose file is missing or unreadable tells you which value to change.
3. Run it from the repository root, for example:

```bash
php examples/create-cii-and-embed/example.php
```

The examples load the library source in this repository through `vendor/autoload.php`. To use one in your own project, copy its `example.php`, install the package instead and change the `require` line to your project's `vendor/autoload.php`:

```bash
composer require invoicexml/facturx
```
